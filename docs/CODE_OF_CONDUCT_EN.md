## Kodluyoruz Open Source | Code of Conduct

This document defines the rules accepted among contributors to Kodluyoruz's open-source projects.

### Why Do We Need a Code of Conduct?

This Code of Conduct is designed to help us build a welcoming, peaceful, fearless, and productive community. Its purpose is not to impose unnecessary rules on our community, apply penalties to "bad" individuals, or try to rectify past wrongdoings. Instead, it aims to enable us to create a great community even when we come together with individuals who may not have adhered to these written rules and may have had to work in less-than-ideal conditions.

## Rules

Everyone contributing to our project must adhere to the following rules:

### 1. Tolerance and Respect

Everyone contributing to our project should welcome and respect all individuals without discrimination based on gender, lifestyle, skin color, ethnic origin, beliefs, or any other characteristic.

### 2. Reject Discrimination

Everyone contributing to our project must unequivocally reject any form of discrimination or divisive actions based on people's color, financial status, race, language, political views, beliefs, gender, or sexual orientation.

### 3. Avoid Discriminatory and Sexist Language

Everyone contributing to our project should strongly oppose any form of discourse and action that could perpetuate gender-based inequality.

### 4. No Blaming for Lack of Knowledge

Everyone contributing to our project should refrain from judging or harming others due to their lack of knowledge on a subject. Everyone may have different knowledge levels and experiences. Therefore, everyone contributing to our project should be open-minded, willing to help one another, and ready to learn together.

### 5. Sharing Knowledge and Teaching Approach

Everyone contributing to our project should adhere to the principle of "teaching the uninformed" in their approach to sharing knowledge and teaching. Each of our project participants may have different interests, experiences, and knowledge levels. Therefore, everyone contributing to our project should pay special attention not only to successful students but also to struggling, demotivated, or nearly demotivated young people who need support.

### 6. Fearless Asking of Questions

Everyone contributing to our project has the freedom to ask questions without hesitation, anytime and about any subject. Additionally, providing clear and understandable answers to questions is important for the development of our project.

### 7. Be Positive and Constructive

Everyone contributing to our project should present their criticisms in a constructive manner and exhibit a positive attitude. Instead of negative critiques, offering suggestions that can contribute to the project and participating in the discussion of these suggestions would be more beneficial.

### 8. Respect Privacy and Copyrights

Everyone contributing to our project should respect project confidentiality and copyrights. To ensure that materials used in our project comply with copyright laws, contributors should only use open-source licenses.
